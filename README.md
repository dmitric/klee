In 1965 a pioneer of computer art named Frieder Nake made a piece of art called ["Hommage à Paul Klee, 13/9/65 Nr.2"](http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O211685/hommage-a-paul-klee-13965-print-nake-frieder/) which was supposedly inspired by Paul Klee's work [Highway and Byways](http://www.paulklee.net/highway-and-byways.jsp).

I have created a parameterized version, I like to call "Hommage à l'Hommage" that allows you to generate similar pieces of work while manipulating its various properties.
